    "\n",
    "Computers do four things:\n",
    "- run programs\n",
    "- store data\n",
    "- communicate with each other, and\n",
    "- interact with us\n",
    "\n",
    "Computers \"interact with us\" in many different ways. Can you name a few?\n",
    "\n",
    "We use hardware interfaces like the keyboard, mouse, touch screen interfaces, or speech recognition using systems. Think of how these interfaces allow us to click selections of menus and drag-and-drop. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although most modern desktop operating systems (OS) communicate with their human users by means of windows, icons and pointers, these software technologies didn’t become widespread until the 1980s. What did we do beforehand?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Command-Line Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "This kind of interface is called a command-line interface, or CLI, to distinguish it from a graphical user interface, or GUI (pronounced: goo-ey), which most people now use. \n",
    "\n",
    "The heart of a CLI is a **read-**e**valuate-**p**rint **l**oop, or **REPL**. When the user types a command and then presses the `Enter` (or `Return`) key, the computer reads it, executes it, and prints its output. The user then types another command, and so on until the user logs off.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Shell\n",
    "\n",
    "The REPL description makes it sound as though the user sends commands directly to the computer, and the computer sends output directly to the user. \n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, there is usually a program in between called a command shell. What the user types goes into the shell, which then figures out what commands to run and orders the computer to execute them. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note** that the command shell is called “the shell” because it encloses the operating system in order to hide some of its complexity and make it simpler to interact with.\n",
    "\n",
    "A shell is a computer program like any other. What’s special about it is that its job is to run other programs rather than to do calculations itself. The most popular shell is Bash, the Bourne Again SHell (so-called because it’s derived from a shell written by Stephen Bourne). Bash is the default shell on most modern implementations of Unix and in most packages that provide Unix-like tools for Windows."

    "- In bioinformatics, you often need to do the same set of tasks with a large number of files. Learning to automate those repetitive tasks in a less error-prone. When humans do the same thing a hundred different times (or even ten times), they’re likely to make a mistake. Your computer can do the same thing a thousand times with no mistakes.\n",
